<p>Hello John! This is an impressive portfolio page and I really wanna congratulate you on job well done. The page looks simple but professional and I really like the implementation responsive design. You have an extensive commit history with only a few
  formatting issues. Your README is polished, but the rest of the code looks rushed and messy. Great work overall!! </p>

<p>Even though, the page is a great start, there is definitely some room for improvement. Here are some of the issues that I saw: </p>


<ul>
  <li>HTML is missing the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code class="prettyprint">&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags.</li>
  <li>The <code class="prettyprint">&lt;span&gt;</code> that starts on line 53 in aboutme.html is being used like a <code class="prettyprint">&lt;div&gt;</code>. Spans are for inline styling, not for creating sections for styling. The <code class="prettyprint">&lt;span&gt;</code>    on line 79 is being used correctly.</li>
  <li>Why do you have 6 stylesheets? You should have one stylesheet for the entire project, then any stylesheet libraries that you may need (such as Bootstrap). One stylesheet named styles.css would incorporate all the styles from aboutme.css, blog.css, lists.css,
    and master.css.</li>
  <li>In blog.html, lines 4-28 are not indented enough.</li>
  <li>In aboutme.html, lines 4-114 are not indented enough.</li>
  <li>In aboutme.html, lines 54-57 and 98 are indented too far.</li>
  <li>In aboutme.html, the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag at the end of line 29 should all be on the same line. Either move the part on line 30 up, or the part on line 29 down.</li>
  <li>In aboutme.html, the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;footer&gt;</code> tag is opened but never closed. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_footer.asp">HTML footer Tag</a> for more information on how to properly use a footer tag.</li>
  <li>In index.html, lines 4-129 are not indented enough.</li>
  <li>In index.html, the <code class="prettyprint">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag at the end of line 30 should all be on the same line. Either move the part on line 31 up, or the part on line 30 down.</li>
  <li>In index.html, lines 52-55 and 98 are indented too far.</li>
  <li>In all HTML files, there is far too much whitespace. Having an inconsistent application of whitespace makes your code look messy and unorganized. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>In blog.html, there are 13 empty lines.</li>
      <li>In aboutme.html, there are 41 empty lines.</li>
      <li>In index.html, there are 63 empty lines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commit messaging is inconsistent. Examples include but are not limited to: <code class="prettyprint">Fixes bootstrap linkpwd</code> and <code class="prettyprint">layout errors, adds content</code>. Better commit messages would be <code class="prettyprint">fix bootstrap link</code>    and <code class="prettyprint">add content to homepage and fix layout errors</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, a great effort! Don&#39;t be discouraged by the number of comments here. There&#39;s quite a bit that&#39;s off, but none of it is very difficult to fix. Please let Franz or I know if any of this is confusing. Fix this up and resubmit for a pass
  as soon as possible. Resubmits will be accepted until August 13th at 8am, but early resubmits are in your best interest. Late resubmits won&#39;t be accepted. Let me know if you have questions. Thanks! --Tim</p>
