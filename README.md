# Portfolio Landing Page

This is the week one code review for the "Intro to Programming" project for Epicodus students.

The objectives this project will accomplish are viewable [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming/git-html-and-css/git-html-and-css-independent-project).

This is the project after being tidied up during the weekend. For the project submitted at 5PM Friday, [click here]

## Getting Started

This project will either be available for download immediately, or will be available on [github pages](https://johnmichaelparsons.github.io/portfolio-landing-page/).

After downloading, drag and drop "index.html" onto an empty Google Chrome tab.

### Prerequisites

If you can view this, then there is a incredibly likely chance that you already have all the prerequisites.

If you can not view this, or are on a mobile browser, I would suggest you accommodate the nearest desktop or laptop computer with an internet connection. For more advanced users, transfer the "Portfolio-landing-page-master" to that computer.
